> **Requirements** **Specification**

**1.** **Introduction**

**1.1** **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the
development of a robust License Management and Validation System for
Software as a Service (SAAS). The system is designed to ensure secure
and centralized license validation for all clients, enhancing the
control and security of software licenses.

**1.2** **Scope**

This system will be integrated into all SAAS products delivered to
clients. It will perform license validation by connecting to a central
server, ensuring the licenses are active and legitimate.

**1.3** **Definitions,** **Acronyms,** **and** **Abbreviations**

> ● **SAAS:** Software as a Service
>
> ● **LMS:** License Management System

**2.** **System** **Overview**

**2.1** **System** **Description**

The License Management and Validation System will be responsible for
validating the authenticity and status of licenses across all SAAS
products delivered to clients. The system will employ strong security
measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

**2.2** **System** **Architecture**

The proposed architecture is inspired by Microsoft's Software
Architectural principles and consists of the following components:

**2.2.1.** **Client-Side** **Component**

> ● **License** **Validator:**
>
> ○ Embed this component into every SAAS product delivered to clients.
>
> ○ Responsible for communicating with the central server to validate
> the license.
>
> ○ Securely store license information locally to minimize unnecessary
> communication.

**2.2.2.** **Central** **Server** **Component**

> ● **License** **Management** **Server:**
>
> ○ Hosted on a highly secure cloud infrastructure.
>
> ○ Handles incoming license validation requests from clients. ○ Manages
> the central database of valid licenses.
>
> ○ Utilizes a secure communication protocol (e.g., HTTPS) for data
> transmission. ● **Database:**
>
> ○ Stores encrypted license data.
>
> ○ Implements backup and recovery mechanisms.

**2.2.3.** **Administrative** **Interface**

> ● **Web-based** **Dashboard:**
>
> ○ Allows administrators to manage licenses, view usage statistics, and
> generate reports.
>
> ○ Implements role-based access control for administrators.

**3.** **Functional** **Requirements**

**3.1** **License** **Validation**

> 1\. **Client-Server** **Communication:**
>
> ○ The License Validator on the client-side communicates securely with
> the License Management Server using industry-standard encryption
> protocols.
>
> ○ The communication must be asynchronous to minimize latency. 2.
> **License** **Activation:**
>
> ○ New licenses must be activated through a secure process initiated by
> the client. 3. **Offline** **Mode:**
>
> ○ The License Validator must support offline mode, allowing limited
> functionality when the client cannot connect to the central server
> temporarily.

**3.2** **License** **Management**

> 4\. **Centralized** **License** **Storage:**
>
> ○ The License Management Server maintains a centralized database
> containing all valid licenses.
>
> 5\. **License** **Revocation:**
>
> ○ Administrators can revoke licenses in case of misuse or other
> security concerns.

**3.3** **Security**

> 6\. **Data** **Encryption:**
>
> ○ All communication between the client and the central server, as well
> as stored data, must be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms.
>
> 7\. **Authentication:**
>
> ○ Use multi-factor authentication for administrator access to the
> License Management Server.
>
> 8\. **Authorization:**
>
> ○ Implement role-based access control for administrators with varying
> levels of access.
>
> 9\. **License** **Integrity** **Checks:**
>
> ○ Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of licenses during
> transmission and storage.
>
> 10\. **Security** **Auditing:**
>
> ○ Log all relevant activities, such as license validation requests,
> administrator actions, and system events.

**3.4** **Reporting** **and** **Monitoring**

> 11\. **Usage** **Statistics:**
>
> ○ Provide administrators with detailed usage statistics, including the
> number of active licenses, usage patterns, and historical data.
>
> 12\. **Alerts** **and** **Notifications:**
>
> ○ Implement an alert system to notify administrators of any suspicious
> activities, license expirations, or security breaches.

**4.** **Non-functional** **Requirements**

**4.1** **Performance**

> 13\. **Scalability:**
>
> ○ The system must handle a growing number of clients and license
> validation requests without compromising performance.
>
> 14\. **Response** **Time:**
>
> ○ License validation requests should have a response time within
> acceptable limits, even during peak usage.

**4.2** **Reliability**

> 15\. **High** **Availability:**
>
> ○ The License Management Server should have a high level of
> availability, minimizing downtime.
>
> 16\. **Backup** **and** **Recovery:**
>
> ○ Regularly back up license data and implement a robust recovery
> mechanism.

**4.3** **Usability**

> 17\. **User-Friendly** **Interface:**
>
> ○ The administrative interface should be intuitive, with clear
> navigation and comprehensive help documentation.

**4.4** **Compliance**

> 18\. **Regulatory** **Compliance:**
>
> ○ Ensure that the system complies with relevant data protection and
> privacy regulations.

**4.5** **Maintainability**

> 19\. **Modularity:**
>
> ○ Design the system with modular components for easy updates and
> maintenance. 20. **Documentation:**
>
> ○ Provide comprehensive documentation for administrators and
> developers.

**5.** **Conclusion**

This License Management and Validation System, designed with a secure
and centralized architecture, will fortify SAAS products by ensuring
legitimate license usage. Adhering to Microsoft's Software Architectural
principles, the system emphasizes security, scalability, and usability.
Implementation and ongoing maintenance will require collaboration
between development, security, and operations teams to achieve optimal
results.
